1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,880
Yeah!

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,520
In case you just got here, I'm Spider-Man.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,240
And I'm in a race against the clock.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,120
So much to be responsible for,

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,480
so little time.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,640
Like weird energy readings
coming from a lab.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,040
Dr. Octopus abandoned before
he went tentacles-up.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,600
But a good leader like me knows
to bring good backup.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,960
Spider, we got company here.
Engaging at the east entry.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,560
Ava Ayala. White Tiger.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,520
Cat-like speed and reflexes.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,800
She's on this.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,800
Power Man,

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,720
Iron Fist:

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,720
Tiger's down.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,120
Any visual on an adversary?

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,560
Yeah. I can't believe it,
but he's alive and moving right for us.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,520
Or is it we who move for him?

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
Perspective defines reality.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,520
Luke Cage, the super strong Power Man.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
And Danny Rand, Iron Fist.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,960
He of chi-powered fist and
haiku shout outs.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
They're on this.

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,720
Nova, light us up, now!

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,680
You don't have to yell in my earpiece,
bug breath.

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,400
Jeez.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,080
Sam Alexander. Nova.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
Loudmouth with a mega helmet.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,200
He's a flier, a fighter,
and a great big flashlight.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
Whoa! Doc Ock, alive?

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,520
Reports of my demise were
greatly exaggerated.

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,680
This would be really bad

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,640
if I wasn't rocking the latest
SHIELD technology.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,680
Now, I'm on this.

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,640
You shouldn't have followed me.

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,800
I didn't, but I'm glad I found you.

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,400
No web fluid? Ah! Yikes!

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,320
This is SHIELD. We have you surrounded.

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
No! Not now!

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,360
Nice to see you're keeping
up on your training.

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,120
Training?

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
M-Maybe you didn't notice, Fury,

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,080
but my web-shooter's jammed
and Ock got away.

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,520
P.S., did you guys even
know he was still alive?

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,800
We heard rumors. But at least he
didn't leave with his prize.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,840
Have to give credit where it's due,
Spider-Man.

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
Your team has been on point lately.

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,000
The SHIELD Helicarrier may not be
back up and operational yet,

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,280
but you're doing us proud.

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,080
I couldn't agree more, Agent Coulson.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
Securing Ock's experimental DNA compounds?

52
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
Incredible work.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,080
Want to stay and lend me a hand testing
these samples, Spider-Man?

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
Do I? You bet, Dr. Conners!

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Oh, sorry.

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,880
Ow! Come on! Stop that! We got to jet.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,720
Teenagers.

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,600
Assume position Alpha Three! Hurry!

59
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,880
- We must hurry. Proceed with haste.
- Coming through. Coming through.

60
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,120
Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time.

61
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
Hey! Ow!

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,320
Come on, come on, come on, come on! Time!

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm home!

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
Oh! Hi, Aunt May.

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,480
Hey, Ms. Parker.

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,880
Hey, guys! What's up?

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
Any excitement today?

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
Who has time for excitement?

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,520
Welcome to casa de Parker.

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,400
After the Helicarrier went kablooey,

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,880
my team moved in with me.

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,520
I always wondered what a bigger family

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
would be like and now I know.

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,760
Hey! Come on! Ow!

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,600
It's been fun,

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,600
but it's also taking
a lot of getting used to.

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,680
Can I get on the computer, Ava?

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,760
I'll be off in just a sec.

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,880
I knew that was coming.

80
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,040
Everybody has their own way of adjusting.

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm just going with the flow

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,800
and looking for a place to work
on my broke-down web-shooters.

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,600
Ah!

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,760
Sorry, Danny.

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
Luke?

86
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,480
Again?

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
Takes a routine to look this good.

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,880
These days, the basement is the only place
I can be alone.

89
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,280
Small price to pay for family, I guess.

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Come on, Aunt May! No pain no gain!
Who kicks butt?

91
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,240
I do!

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,440
And cue my exit music. Uh-oh.

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
Want to stay and lend me
a hand testing these samples,

94
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,080
Spider-Man?

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,640
A high-tech lab plus a super
scientist mentor?

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,920
That equals the best idea
I ever almost forgot.

97
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
No web slinging would be a problem
for an average spider-man,

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,960
but an ultimate spidey just says,

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,280
"Hello, SHIELD-issued spidey cycle."

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Goodbye, gridlock.

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,000
Hello, solitude.

102
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,600
Ah. See?

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
There's your clogging problem.

104
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,720
The intake canister's cracked.

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,760
Causing the web fluid to leak. Huh.

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,560
You're a lifesaver, Doc.

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,280
Me?

108
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,480
No, no, no. That's your job.

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm just your friendly neighborhood
one-armed scientist.

110
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,680
From the day I first joined SHIELD,

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,080
Doc Connors was a hundred percent
cool peeps.

112
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,680
A fellow science geek,

113
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,880
and if I'm being completely honest,

114
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,280
a real mentor for me.

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
I still feel responsible
for him losing his arm.

116
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
There. Good as new.

117
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
Uh, better. Tap twice.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
Flash webs?

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,720
Cool!

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Simple upgrade.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,720
Us brains have to stick together, right?

122
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,680
Uh, speaking of which,

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,280
I want you to see what Octavius was after.

124
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
I think you'll find this particularly

125
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
interesting considering your power set.

126
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,520
Whoa! Is this animal DNA?

127
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Do you see what he was getting at?

128
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,400
He wanted to open an evil petting zoo?

129
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,680
I believe Otto was inspired by you

130
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,840
to try and create a group
of people powered

131
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,160
by specific DNA sequences.

132
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Ah. The old "Build an animal army
world domination" gag.

133
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
I'm glad we put the kibosh on that.

134
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,960
But place this technology in the hands

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,600
of a scientist who isn't a madman and
then what do you get?

136
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
He's not thinking what
I think he's thinking.

137
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,920
Is he?

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,200
I think these animal compounds could

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
regenerate a damaged human body.

140
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
I know it sounds far-fetched, but,

141
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,480
well, look at how you turned out.

142
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,400
I got lucky.

143
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,240
But look at Venom or-or Goblin

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,040
if you want the usual results of Ock's
genetic guesswork.

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,560
Of course.

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,520
You-You're right.
I shouldn't rush into anything.

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,800
Hey,

148
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,600
that doesn't mean we can't dig
deep into his notes.

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,520
Okay. Have to be super careful.

150
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,600
Don't want to trip any of Ock's
nutso security.

151
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,320
Just leave that to me.

152
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Welcome, intruder.

153
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,800
You want my tech?

154
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,280
Have at it.

155
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
Hey, what is that?

156
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,520
What's going on?

157
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Wilcox, call for backup.

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
That might be my fault.

159
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,440
The sample vials!

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,160
Oh!

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
Science, later. Saving, now.

162
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
Look out!

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh, no. No!

164
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,440
Intruder alert.

165
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,440
Spider-Man!

166
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Huh?

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,640
Oh, really?

168
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
After all I've lived through,

169
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,000
it ends on a steel slab and a laser?

170
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,040
What the what?

171
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Wow! Thanks!

172
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Remarkable.

173
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,120
Doc?

174
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
Uh,

175
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
high-five?

176
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
What'd you do?

177
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,320
I saved you. With science!

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,720
Doc, did you just...

179
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
I appreciate the hand... Help! Help.
I-I mean help.

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,800
But you shouldn't have taken the serum.

181
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
Perhaps.

182
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,760
But I feel incredible.

183
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Yeah?

184
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,960
Well, my spidey-sense
just started ringing like

185
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,720
a firehouse and I'm guessing
you're the alarm.

186
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,640
Well, it can't be me. I'm fine.

187
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,400
Look.

188
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,560
Look out!

189
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
He brought friends!

190
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,720
We can handle this, Spidey. You and me.

191
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,520
Together.

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,480
While impromptu team-ups
are a norm in this biz,

193
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,640
I can honestly say I did not expect...

194
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
Spider-Man and Man-Lizard.

195
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,160
Combating evil with
the forces of nature on their side.

196
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,960
Spider-Man and Man-Lizard!

197
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
We make a good team, huh?

198
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,160
Team?

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Doc, are you feeling all right?

200
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,520
You look a little green.

201
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,800
Doc Ock puts the "mad" in mad scientist.

202
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,760
Who knows what his lizard juice
is doing to you.

203
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm great.

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
I do have a slight itch
at the back of my brain,

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,760
but maybe more.

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,320
Hey, Doc! A little help here!

207
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,920
With some fine tuning,

208
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
Otto's work could cure me
and thousands like me.

209
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,960
I need to ask him

210
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,640
if he has more of this substance
hidden somewhere.

211
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,560
Imagine what other advances
the world might have

212
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,400
if we could hold him back from
the brink of his madness.

213
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
Other advances?

214
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,840
I don't think you're in the win
column yet.

215
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,280
I get that you and
Ock were friends back in college,

216
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
but the only mind that could even begin

217
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,080
to make sense of Ock's
weird work is Ock's!

218
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,560
Exactly. But not if we don't
give him the chance!

219
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,680
Doc?

220
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,200
Oh, boy.

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
No.

222
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,040
What happened to you?

223
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,920
If Otto is the only one who can
perfect my change,

224
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,080
then I must find him.

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,640
Whoa!

226
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
His great power...

227
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,200
Now my responsibility.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,960
Stop! Wait up!

229
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,000
You need a Jurassic intervention!

230
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,760
Oh, don't lizards have ears?

231
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,680
Whatever's happening to you needs
to be looked at, fast.

232
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,160
Uh, besides, finding Ock is a needle
in a haystack.

233
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
It's impossible.

234
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,480
No,

235
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,600
I can smell him,

236
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
like lizards do.

237
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
With my tongue. He's in the sewers.

238
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,880
Ew.

239
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
That is gross on every level.

240
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,840
You need real help,

241
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
before you start spending
all day eating flies

242
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,840
and looking for hot rocks to lie on.

243
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Spider-Man to SHIELD: Need backup.

244
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
I can reach Otto.

245
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
SHIELD will just lock him up,

246
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
take all this from me.

247
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,520
I can't lose him again.

248
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
May be too late for that,

249
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,080
but it's not too late to tail you.

250
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
Tail. I slay myself.

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,720
Web brain, where you at?

252
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Sam! I'm... Is that limbo music?

253
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,960
Oh, May pulled it out. It's killer!

254
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,240
No. "Killer" is a lizardy Doc Connors

255
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,720
on his way to find Doc Ock.

256
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,080
Meet me in the sewers at these...

257
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,760
Sewers?

258
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,720
Hmm. Sounds like a dream come poo.

259
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,560
I-I mean "true." No, I mean "poo."

260
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,200
Trace my coordinates. Get here!

261
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,920
You got it, big guy.
And we'll bring the air freshener.

262
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,480
What do you want me to say?

263
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,720
"You're welcome"?

264
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
You took an untested formula

265
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,400
that wasn't even yours!

266
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,680
You deserve what you got.

267
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,800
Don't mock me, Otto.

268
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,280
Perfect this and it help millions.

269
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,040
You laugh at me? Your savior-er?

270
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,400
Can you hear yourself, freak?

271
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,120
You've taken the mind of a genius

272
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,880
and turned it into a pea-brain.

273
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm just as smart as I ever were!

274
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,560
Was. Ever was-er.

275
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,520
I know how to fix you.

276
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,920
But I do like what the serum
has done with your skin,

277
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,160
monster.

278
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,560
You want monster, Octopus?

279
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,680
I'll show monster!

280
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,360
I need options.

281
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Plan one:

282
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
Let them rip each other to shreds.

283
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,040
Plan two: Call the team again.

284
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
No signal here in Smellville.

285
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,000
Plan three:

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
Outmatched and alone,
like in the action movies.

287
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,120
Three it is.

288
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
And here I am without my popcorn.

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,280
Spider-Man, protect me.

290
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,880
Spidey,

291
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,600
can you hear me?

292
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,800
Web-head, are you there?

293
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,680
Web-head, do you copy? Hello?

294
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,240
Dr. Connors, please! Don't do this!

295
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,880
Oh!

296
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,600
See?

297
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,240
I knew there was still a good guy
inside that lizard skin.

298
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,080
Stay out of my way!

299
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
We have to stop meeting like this.

300
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,560
This is no time for your puerile
attempts at humor!

301
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
Puerile?

302
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,240
I don't know what that means,

303
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,520
but when I find out...

304
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,320
Hey!

305
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,480
You are not going to hurt my friend!

306
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
You said you could fix him!

307
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
There's no "him" to fix.

308
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
It's one hundred percent reptile now.

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
He's not an "it"!

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,040
Your serum is making him irrational.

311
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,680
It could've happened to any of us.

312
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,920
Stop!

313
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Connors! No!

314
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,160
I'm not giving up on you!

315
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,720
I know you're still in there.

316
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,720
And Ock knows how to get you out,

317
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,520
but you have to help me help you!

318
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,720
Say "cheese" for flash-webs!

319
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,000
Sorry to use your own tech against you,
Doc.

320
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,720
Neither one of us will escape here alive,
unless...

321
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,880
Please don't say it.

322
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,560
We team up.

323
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Spider-Man, super-villain team-up.

324
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,520
My brain goes to some strange
places sometimes.

325
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,640
This way. I have a plan.

326
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,200
You ever feel like the title "Doctor"

327
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,440
might be slightly undeserved in your case?

328
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,400
It worked, didn't it?

329
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,480
Yeah, you make a solid dog-catcher.

330
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,080
What did you put in that serum, Ock?

331
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,240
Whoa, whoa!

332
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
Okay, Ock, plan B?

333
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,200
Have you ever heard
the term "sacrificial lamb"?

334
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,280
Spidey sense!

335
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,480
Hey!

336
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,040
No one rang the recess bell!

337
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,040
Come back here! Tell me the cure!

338
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
Why don't you just go steal it from

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,840
my lab where he stole my serum.

340
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,480
Come on! You know me!

341
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
Me, Spider-Man. You, Doc Connors!

342
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
Ooh! My bad on the snout kick,

343
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,200
but I got to run!

344
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
Hey, why don't you follow me?

345
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,200
This way.

346
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,079
Come on! Come on, I dare you!

347
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,680
Hunt? Yes!

348
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,400
Hunt, no.

349
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
Plan? Yes.

350
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,960
Hey! I'm walking here.

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,240
Sheesh! Superheroes these days.

352
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,200
No respect for their elders.

353
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,120
This was you plan?

354
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,680
No, this was me plan.

355
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
You called, Spidey?

356
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,880
Doc's a lizard? Huh. Cold-blooded.

357
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,760
Already did that one and better.

358
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,920
Y'all play nice, now.

359
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,320
He's still our friend underneath
all that scaly scary.

360
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,120
Back in a few!

361
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
Please let this work.

362
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,680
Now,

363
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,600
let's hope my science skills
are up to the task

364
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,200
my fists haven't been able to solve.

365
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,560
Keep him distracted!

366
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,040
Trying.

367
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,040
But he's getting stronger!

368
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,520
You have about two seconds, Spider!

369
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,360
Make it count!

370
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,840
Huh?

371
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,760
Doc Connors, are you okay?

372
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,360
Yeah.

373
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,680
Where am I?

374
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,840
What-What am I doing?

375
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,440
Oh, dude! You turned into a big, ugly...

376
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,480
You were trying to help me.

377
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,240
Things just got a little out of hand.

378
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,120
Ooh, sorry.

379
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
Wrong turn of phrase.

380
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
No.

381
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,840
No. It's...

382
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,400
Dr. Connors is lucky you found him,
Spider-Man.

383
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,920
We have to help him, Coulson.

384
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,480
He's our responsibility.

385
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,400
He's part of our big, crazy SHIELD family.

386
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,400
Uh-oh.

387
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,640
We got to skedaddle!

388
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
Let me know how he is, okay?

389
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Don't worry.

390
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
You did your part, we'll do ours.

391
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,200
Dinner!

392
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,960
At the end of a day like today,

393
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,840
a lot of things can come into focus.

394
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,160
Like, solitude's not
all it's cracked up to be.

395
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
And my team?

396
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,600
I should get as much time
with them as I can.

397
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,920
Stick together,

398
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,160
like a family.

399
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,840
Oh, Peter, you're just in time!
Sam made dinner.

400
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,000
Sam? Cooks?

401
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,800
He's quite talented.

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,160
A bird, some heat. No biggie.

403
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,880
Oh, don't worry, Danny.
I made some grilled tofu for you.

404
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,480
Just like a real family.

405
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,840
My totally amazing family.
